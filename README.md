# CSC-210-Final-Project-UR-Mart

1. Our Plan:
We plan to build an online shopping application called UrMart, similar to Amazon or
eBay. Our target audience are independent online merchants who sell products
alongside customers who seek products unavailable on more popular sites.
Our application will include these features listed below: <br>
● Using Flask as our web framework.<br>
● Deployed on Heroku.<br>
● Product database with vital data (e.g. SKU, Brand Name, etc,...).<br>
● User Authentication for sellers - who are UrMart's employees.<br>
● Sellers need to sign up then login to use CRUD functions on products (e.g. create new products, delete existing ones,...).<br>
● Buyers can add items to a cart which show which items are in, each added item's quantity, along with their individual/total prices.<br>
More features or functionalities might be added as we work on this project - all of which
will be properly documented/reported.
